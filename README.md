# August-Keyboard-Layout

This is an optimized Dvorak keyboard layout. If you're here, and wondering if YOU should use it, I would say it's very unlikely. The potential userbase is people who:

1. currently use a Dvorak keyboard layout (since this is an optimized variant of Dvorak)
2. are insufficiently happy with how vastly superior the Dvorak layout is over the Qwerty layout
3. are willing to learn a new keyboard layout that changes the location of 23 keys relative to Dvorak (that's way overkill, in hindsight)

For those people (probably only me), I can recommend it. I've typed on it for 10 years now (as of 2025). For more details see [here](https://rawdata.stream/2025/07/31/august-keyboard-layout/).

But mainly, it's here so I have easy access to it when I'm on a new machine, because it's painful for me to type without it.
